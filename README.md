Core idea : Pocket tanks war with word guessing/Hangman.

Game Concept: This is a game at the intersection of concepts derived from Word Guessing or the game Hangman (similar to the wheel of fortune TV show) and War-Action games. For guessing the words, the user can choose a category from given options. The end goal of the user is to guess a word at each level in the shortest amount of time. 
 
Gameplay: Initially the player is given a war chest say 100 pts to purchase a set of weapons like (Bazooka, Fireball, Napalm etc). Each weapon has a damage number, which it inflicts on the target. There are multiple levels in this game. In the first level the player has to hit the target using physics principles, setting an initial velocity and projectile angle to hit the target located at a distance. Based on the accuracy of the player, a backend algorithm generates clues for the word to be guessed. If the player guesses the word correctly he/she gets points accordingly (and also bonus points for getting it right in one attempt and not taking multiple attempts on the target plus the time saved.) If the guess is incorrect, then the player resumes the attempts with another weapon. The level ends when the time runs out or the weapons are exhausted. 
 
Variations of the Game: We have multiple upgrades/ variations in mind while designing the game. We can have a single target or a target similar to the darts board where there are multiple points for hitting different sections of the target (See screenshots attached). Based on this the clues are unboxed. For example, if the player hits a hard section, then they get more favorable clues and if the player hits an easy section of the target, they get less favorable clues. The way the clues are generated are based on the algorithm we have on the backend. Some other modifications include having picture clues rather than just characters being unboxed like in wheel of fortune, or having synonyms of words like codenames for future levels to make them more challenging.


Backend Algorithm :
For generating the corpus of words, we plan on scraping the English dictionary for a word set, typically having 6-7 or more alphabets per word. Once we have a corpus, we would have a recommendation model, which based on the target accuracy of the user, gives the alphabets to be revealed to the player. The initial idea is to assign frequency scores to the alphabets based on their usage from a corpus, and select those alphabets to be revealed which add up to the normalized [0-1] playerâ€™s hit/aim score for a particular round. This hit score can be calculated using a number of parameters such as the target hit or not, the proximity to the target, the velocity with which it hit the target, the damage done to the target scope and a number of other params etc. We can break ties by revealing the set of alphabets which have a bigger sample size.
 
In the below diagrams, we can see a rough sketch, where the player is trying to hit the target with a weapon and based on the hit score, the clues of the word get unboxed.
